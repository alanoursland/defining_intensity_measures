Below is a set of **specific, actionable suggestions** for each of the \textbf{subsubsections} in your draft. These suggestions focus on:

1. **Improving clarity and pedagogical flow** (so that undergraduates can follow the discussion).  
2. **Adding examples and visual aids** (to make the material more concrete).  
3. **Adapting sections to also serve as a concise reference** in research papers (e.g., a condensed “Background” section).

Because your text is extensive, I have broken these recommendations into multiple segments. This response covers all subsubsections through Section 5.3 (the last place you saw the network error). If you need more for later sections (5.4, 6.1, 6.2), just let me know.

# Section 1: Introduction

## 1.1.1 **Formal Definition of a Measure**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Insert a simple table showing how a measure \(\mu\) might be assigned to subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\) (e.g., intervals \([0,1]\), \([1,2]\)) to illustrate \(\sigma\)-additivity.  
   - This clarifies how “measure” generalizes from length to more abstract notions.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small figure or a flowchart representing the three axioms (non-negativity, null empty set, \(\sigma\)-additivity) can help undergraduates see them at a glance.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize real-world parallels: e.g., in probability, the measure of the entire sample space is 1; in geometry, the measure of an empty set is 0.  
   - This helps connect the formal properties to things they already know (like area or probability).

---

## 1.1.2 **Examples of Common Measures**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - For each measure (e.g., length, probability, energy, similarity), \emph{briefly} show a numeric illustration: “For instance, a Euclidean distance in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) between \((1,2)\) and \((3,4)\) is \(\sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (2-4)^2} = \sqrt{8}\).”  
   - This helps undergraduates see the measure “in action.”

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A single panel figure with mini-plots: one panel showing a distance in 2D, one showing a probability distribution, one formula for energy. Keep it simple—each panel can have 1–2 lines of labeling.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - If space allows, mention briefly how each measure arises from different axioms or assumptions (e.g., the assumption of a Euclidean norm vs. a different norm).

---

## 1.1.3 **The Problem with Intensity Measures**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Give a short anecdote: “In an image classification network, we often see an output neuron with activation 13.2 vs. another with 2.4, but we call 13.2 ‘strong intensity.’ Yet, this is arbitrary if we shift all activations by +10 or multiply by 0.5.”  
   - This clarifies how “intensity” might be misinterpreted.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small “slider bar” graphic or bar chart of two neural activations. Show how rescaling these bars does not change the classification outcome but might change naive “intensity” interpretations.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize the difference between an “absolute scale” vs. a “relative scale.” This sets the stage for the upcoming sections on competitive distance.

---

# Section 1.2: Distance vs. Intensity: The Problem

## 1.2.1 **Distance: A Well-Defined Measure**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Briefly show how, in a 2D plane, Euclidean distance satisfies the four metric axioms. You could do a micro-example: points \(A=(0,0), B=(3,4)\) to illustrate the triangle inequality with a third point \(C\).

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small triangle in the plane labeled with distances to illustrate the triangle inequality. This solidifies that distance is \emph{not} just an abstract concept but a geometric reality.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Remind readers that many classification methods (like nearest neighbor) are built on these distance properties, reinforcing the “foundational” aspect.

---

## 1.2.2 **Intensity: A Concept Without Formal Definition**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a softmax layer’s raw logits from a simple 3-class example. E.g., \((z_1, z_2, z_3) = (2.0, 5.0, 5.1)\). Then highlight how we \emph{interpret} 5.1 as “strong activation,” but that alone lacks a formal scale.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small bar plot with three bars at heights 2.0, 5.0, and 5.1. Indicate how “absolute intensities” can be misleading if we do not consider the \emph{differences} among them.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Connect to everyday examples: volume knobs on two different amplifiers do not have the same absolute scale. “10” on one may not match “10” on another. This resonates with the idea of “intensity” being context-dependent.

---

## 1.2.3 **Why the Traditional View of Intensity is Problematic**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Discuss a simple neural net \emph{thought experiment} where you add a constant bias to all final-layer neurons. The classification outcome remains the same, but if we took absolute activation as “intensity,” everything is artificially boosted.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A before/after diagram of final-layer neuron outputs. Show how shifting them by +5 keeps the relative differences but “inflates intensities” if someone took them at face value.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Summarize the bullet points of the problems (lack of scale consistency, unbounded growth, overconfidence, boundary ignorance) with short real examples (a table with old activation vs. new activation, same classification).

---

## 1.2.4 **The Need for a Competitive Distance Framework**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Provide a short 2D classification problem: two classes with prototypes at \((0,0)\) and \((5,5)\). Show a point \((2.5,2.5)\). Emphasize how the distance to each prototype is the real factor in deciding which class wins.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A 2D plane plot with two points labeled as class centers, plus a test sample. Maybe color the Voronoi diagram to highlight “closest class region.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Indicate how comparing distances to multiple prototypes generalizes naturally to multi-class scenarios. This sets the stage for the formula \( S_c(x) = f(D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)) \).

---

## 1.2.5 **Conclusion**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Briefly restate the 2D scenario from 1.2.4 as a concluding reference.  
   - Or give a short bullet “Take-Home Points” list.

2. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Use a succinct summary bullet list: “Distance is well-defined. Intensity is not. Classification decisions revolve around relative separation, not absolute magnitude.”

---

# Section 1.3: What This Chapter Will Do

## 1.3.1 **Chapter Structure**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Provide a short “map” or flowchart of the chapter, indicating each major section with a one-sentence summary. Undergraduates appreciate a “big picture” overview.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A simple flow diagram with boxes labeled “Section 2: Distance,” “Section 3: Intensity,” “Section 4: Competitive Distance,” etc.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that each section builds on the previous. This helps them anticipate the learning journey.

---

## 1.3.2 **A Paradigm Shift: From Absolute Activation to Competitive Distance**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Possibly re-introduce the Bigfoot analogy in a bullet form. Or pick another real-world scenario (e.g., deciding which restaurant is “best”—the question is always “best compared to what?”).

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - An icon or micro-cartoon illustrating the difference between “absolute rating” vs. “relative rating” (e.g., 4.5 vs. 4.7 stars).

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that this shift is not purely theoretical but changes how we interpret network outputs in practice.

---

# Section 2: The Foundation of Distance Measures

## 2.1.1 **Metric Spaces and Distance Functions**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a simple 1D metric: \(d(x,y) = |x-y|\). Then explicitly verify the four axioms with quick bullet checks (non-negativity, identity, symmetry, triangle inequality).

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A timeline or number line with points labeled to illustrate the concept of distance in 1D.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Let undergraduates see at least one “proof outline” of the triangle inequality or identity of indiscernibles for an easy case (like 1D). That cements the concept.

---

## 2.1.2 **Common Distance Metrics**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - For each metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, Mahalanobis, Cosine, KL-divergence), provide a one-line “in practice” scenario. E.g., “Manhattan is relevant to city block paths,” “Cosine to text similarity,” etc.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - Possibly a mini-table. Rows = metric name, columns = formula, typical usage, key property.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize the difference between true metrics (satisfying the triangle inequality) and divergences (like KL) that do not.

---

## 2.2 **Distance as the Foundational Measure**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Use a cartoon of three points: show how you can define similarity as \(1/(1+d)\). This drives home that distance is “primary.”

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A simplified schematic indicating “distance \(\rightarrow\) transform \(\rightarrow\) similarity.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Summarize again that *almost all* similarity or “intensity” measures can be re-expressed in terms of distance.

---

# Section 3: The Problem with Intensity

## 3.1 **The Illusion of Intensity**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a mock neural layer: 3 neurons with activations (10, 9, 0.5). If we scale them all by 2, the classification is unchanged, but naive “intensity” doubles.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - Bar chart or table with two sets of activations: “Original” vs. “Scaled.” Emphasize the classification decision is unaffected.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Relate to how illusions in everyday life always involve comparing something to a baseline. This sets up the conceptual link to “contrastive distance.”

---

## 3.2 **Why Intensity Cannot Be a Direct Negation of Distance**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Give a short numeric demonstration with a single distance: If \(D_c(x)\) can be large, then \(-D_c(x)\) would be negative or unbounded. Show how it leads to absurd scenarios if you interpret it as “intensity.”

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A 1D plot showing “distance from class c” on the x-axis, and “\(-D_c\)” on the y-axis, going unbounded negatively.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Underscore that classification is always multi-class, so focusing on “negate the single distance” misses how competition changes everything.

---

## 3.3 **The True Definition: Intensity as Competitive Distance**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Return to your 2-class prototypes in a 2D plane. Let \((0,0)\) be class A, \((4,4)\) be class B. Show how \(S_A(x) = f(D_B(x) - D_A(x))\). A quick numeric example for a point \((2,1)\) can illustrate the concept.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - The same 2D plane with decision boundary line (the set of points equidistant between \((0,0)\) and \((4,4)\)). Label a point and calculate the “competitive distance difference.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Provide an explicit formula for a simple choice of \(f\), e.g., linear difference or an exponential. Then show how, near the boundary, \(S_c(x)\) is small, away from boundary it is large.

---

# Section 4: Competitive Distance and Classification

## 4.1 **The Real Meaning of Classification Confidence**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - A toy 3-class system with prototypes in 2D. Show a point that is “closer” to class 1 than to class 2 or 3. Numerically compute \(D_1, D_2, D_3\), highlight the difference.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small Voronoi diagram with three centers, and a star marking the input. Possibly color code the difference: “distance to chosen class” vs. “distance to next best alternative.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize the meaning of “confidence” in this context: a bigger margin (difference in distances) means higher confidence.

---

## 4.2 **Why This Definition Prevents Pathological Behavior**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show how uniform scaling of distances (e.g., doubling or halving all distances) does not change the difference \(D_{\neg c} - D_c\) in a fundamental sense. Provide a numeric example.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - Maybe a small line graph or bar chart indicating “distance to target = 2” vs. “distance to target = 4,” but the difference to the competitor also doubled, so classification outcome is the same.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Summarize each “pathology” (unbounded growth, overconfidence, sensitivity to scaling, adversarial vulnerability) in a bulleted list, with a short line on how the new definition mitigates each.

---

## 4.3 **Transforming Competitive Distance into a Probability Measure**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Demonstrate with a single example: let \(S_c(x) = D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)\). Then define a softmax-like transformation. Show the resulting probabilities. Possibly show how a point near the boundary yields ~0.5 for two classes, and near a center yields something close to 1.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A side-by-side numeric table: one column is raw differences (competitive distances), next is their exponentials, last is normalized probabilities. It helps novices see the step-by-step transformation.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that decision boundaries remain the same if we use a monotonic transformation. Probability is just a “nice” way to interpret the competition in a [0,1] scale.

---

# Section 5: Broader Implications of This Framework

## 5.1 **Why Softmax Works: A Distance Perspective**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show how a typical logit set \((z_1, z_2, z_3)\) can be \(\bigl(-(D_1 - D_{\neg 1}), -(D_2 - D_{\neg 2}), \dots\bigr)\).  
   - Then walk through a quick numeric example to show it yields the same classification but clarifies the geometry.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A cartoon of a final network layer: “Distance-based logits” going into a softmax function. Label each arrow with \(-(D_c - D_{\neg c})\).

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Mention how this perspective can reduce confusion about “why large logit differences yield near-1 probabilities.” It’s about large differences in distances.

---

## 5.2 **Improving Neural Networks with Explicit Competitive Distance**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a pseudo-code snippet for a final layer that computes “prototype vectors,” measures distances, then forms logits as \(z_c = -(\|x - w_c\| - \min_{c'\neq c}\|x - w_{c'}\|)\). This helps concretize the idea for undergraduates or advanced readers wanting to see code-like detail.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small block diagram of a network: input \(\to\) feature extractor \(\to\) distances to each class weight \(\to\) difference block \(\to\) softmax.  
   - This clarifies how it might be “wired” in practice.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that these modifications do not necessarily complicate the network drastically but shift interpretability and robustness.

---

## 5.3 **Cognitive Science and Perception Models**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Briefly illustrate color opponent processing: e.g., red-green channel \(\Rightarrow\) you could say “Perceived color intensity is actually about how far in the red direction you are relative to green, not an absolute measure.”

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A simple schematic of two “opponent” channels (like red-green, blue-yellow). Show that the net perception is a difference-based measure.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Connect to real illusions: e.g., “checkerboard illusions,” which highlight how context (the background or adjacent squares) changes perceived intensity. This parallels “competitive distance” in the brain.

---

## Section 5.4: How BatchNorm Reinforces Competitive Distance Learning

### 5.4.1 **BatchNorm as an Approximate Mahalanobis Transform**

1. **Actionable Example:**
   - Show a **mini table** of raw activations \(x\) across a batch (e.g., three samples), their batch mean \(\mu_{\text{batch}}\), and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\text{batch}}\).  
   - Then explicitly compute \(\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mu_{\text{batch}}}{\sigma_{\text{batch}}}\) for one or two example features. This helps undergraduates see the mechanics of BatchNorm.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **simple schematic** or flowchart that depicts:
     1. Inputs to a layer  
     2. Mean/variance computation across a batch  
     3. Normalization step \(\hat{x}\)  
     4. Learnable shift and scale \(\gamma\), \(\beta\)  
   - Label the “before” vs. “after” activation distributions to illustrate how the shape is normalized.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that “diagonal normalization” (using variances per dimension) is akin to partially whitening the feature space, which relates to the Mahalanobis distance if one had full covariance information.

---

### 5.4.2 **BatchNorm as a Competitive Distance Normalizer**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Provide a 2D or 3D example where features from two classes overlap. Show how applying BatchNorm across these features reduces scale differences, enabling clearer distance comparisons.  
   - For instance, you could generate a small dataset (4–5 points in each class) and plot it before and after BatchNorm.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **before/after scatter plot** where the “before” plot shows significant difference in scale along one axis, and the “after” plot (BatchNorm-applied) shows a more uniform spread. This highlights how distance-based separability can improve.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Draw attention to the “competitive distance” aspect by pointing out that once features are normalized, it’s easier for the network (or the distance metric) to accurately compare how close each point is to class prototypes.

---

### 5.4.3 **Reinterpreting BatchNorm in Competitive Distance Learning**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - A short snippet of pseudo-code or an equation block showing how, if you treat each hidden representation as a candidate for distance-based classification, BatchNorm helps keep all feature dimensions on a comparable scale.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **small block diagram**: input \(\rightarrow\) feature extraction \(\rightarrow\) BatchNorm \(\rightarrow\) distance computation \(\rightarrow\) final classification. Label each step to clarify the pipeline.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Reinforce the idea that “BatchNorm \(\approx\) partial whitening,” which intrinsically supports distance comparisons. Undergraduates often find it easier to remember concepts when they see them tied directly to known transforms (like whitening).

---

### 5.4.4 **Can BatchNorm Be Improved for Competitive Distance Learning?**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Sketch out a hypothetical **“class-wise BatchNorm”** approach: you might compute separate means/variances for each class in the batch (when possible) and show how that could keep each class cluster distinct.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **conceptual figure** comparing:
     1. Standard BatchNorm (one global mean/variance)  
     2. Class-wise BatchNorm (mean/variance per class)  
     - Possibly illustrate it with color-coded “class means” so readers can see the difference.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize trade-offs: class-wise statistics can be more accurate for distance separation but could also be harder to implement (small mini-batches might not have enough samples of each class). This helps undergraduates see the practical challenges of advanced normalization schemes.

---

## Section 6: Conclusion and Future Work

### 6.1 **What We Have Established**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Compile a **bulleted recap** of key numeric or conceptual examples used throughout the chapter (e.g., the 2D prototypes example, the Bigfoot anecdote, the margin-based toy scenario). Each bullet references where it appeared in the text so students or researchers can revisit them for clarity.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **summary “mind map”** of all concepts: 
     - “Distance as a fundamental measure”  
     - “Competitive distance vs. absolute intensity”  
     - “Implications: Softmax, Adversarial Robustness, Cognitive Science”  
   - A single figure tying them together helps visually minded readers see the big picture.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - End with a short, clear bullet list of the top 5–6 “take-home messages.” For instance:
     1. Distance is more fundamental than intensity.  
     2. Classification confidence depends on relative distances…  
     3. Softmax can be reinterpreted as transforming contrastive distances…  
     4. Etc.

4. **Condensing for a Research Paper:**  
   - In a short “Background” section, this entire conclusion can be reduced to a single paragraph referencing your earlier sections. You can say: “In summary, we define classification as a competitive distance process, bridging measure theory, neural network design, and cognitive perception.”

---

### 6.2 **Future Research Directions**

#### 6.2.1 **Refining Distance-Based Neural Architectures**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Offer a short bullet of potential design modifications: e.g., “Use weight vectors as class prototypes and enforce a margin-based loss that explicitly maximizes \(D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)\).”
   - Possibly show a micro snippet of PyTorch-style pseudocode if appropriate for your audience.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small “conceptual pipeline” or architecture diagram for a prototype-based network, highlighting the “distance comparison” step.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Point out that undergraduates can attempt these modifications as a project. E.g., “Try rewriting a standard classification head to compute distances to learned prototypes, then feed them into a softmax.”

---

#### 6.2.2 **Improving Calibration and Uncertainty Estimation**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a toy reliability diagram (probability vs. actual accuracy) for a standard softmax network vs. a distance-based network. Explain how the slope or calibration changes.  
   - Even a contrived numeric example of 10 data points can illustrate the difference in calibration.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - The **reliability diagram** itself, or a simple table with “softmax conf. vs. fraction correct” vs. “distance-based conf. vs. fraction correct.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that bridging the gap between confidence and true likelihood is crucial in sensitive domains (medical, autonomous driving). This motivates undergraduates and researchers alike.

---

#### 6.2.3 **Enhancing Adversarial Robustness**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Show a small 2D or 3D dataset where a point is near a boundary. Demonstrate how a small perturbation changes the distance difference \(D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)\) more (or less) than it changes raw logits. This clarifies why distance-based measures could detect or resist adversarial moves.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A **split panel** with “original input” vs. “adversarial input,” highlighting the shift in distance difference.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Stress that undergraduates can try “adversarial attacks 101” (like FGSM) on a simple dataset (MNIST) using a distance-based final layer to see empirically how robust it might be.

---

#### 6.2.4 **Bridging Machine Learning and Cognitive Science**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Mention a possible psych experiment: “Participants judge whether a shape is closer to circle or square.” Humans do so by a sense of relative difference in shape features. This parallels “distance to circle prototype vs. distance to square prototype.”  
   - Suggest designing an undergrad project that compares human confusion near the boundary with how a distance-based classifier ranks confidence.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small figure showing a morph continuum from circle to square. Mark the “decision boundary” for humans. Show how it aligns with a distance-based boundary.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Undergraduates studying cognitive science or psychology can see how this extends to illusions, speech categorization, color opponency, etc.

---

#### 6.2.5 **Generalizing the Competitive Distance Framework**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - Give a one-liner for how you might incorporate “distance differences” in regression tasks or structured prediction. E.g., “In structured prediction, one could compare the distance of a proposed label structure to that of alternative structures.”

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - A small bullet diagram listing new domains: Clustering, Bayesian methods, manifold learning, etc., with “distance-based perspective” arrows linking them.

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Emphasize that the concept of “distance as measure” and “competition among alternatives” can unify many advanced topics. This helps undergraduates see the scope of future exploration.

---

### 6.2.6 **Conclusion**

1. **Actionable Example:**  
   - End with a **final short paragraph** that explicitly ties back to the early illusions or Bigfoot analogy. Show how the “mysteries” or confusions about intensity vanish under a distance-based lens.

2. **Visual Aid:**  
   - Potentially reuse or reference one earlier figure to “close the loop,” reminding readers how the entire argument started with the problem of “intensity” and ends with “competitive distance resolution.”

3. **Pedagogical Tip:**  
   - Provide 2–3 “take-home bullet points” that look forward: e.g., “Future networks will likely incorporate explicit distance constraints,” “Human perception seems to do the same,” etc. This helps undergraduates remember the forward-looking stance of your work.

---

## Final Remarks on Pedagogical vs. Condensed Research Uses

- **Undergraduate Textbook Approach:**  
  - Keep the numeric examples, short exercises, and visual diagrams in the main text. Possibly add “Chapter Exercises” that ask students to verify certain properties or replicate a small distance-based classification experiment in Python.

- **Condensed Academic Paper Approach:**  
  - Compress the illustrative examples into short references or figures in an appendix/supplement. Summarize the main theoretical points in 1–2 paragraphs in the “Background” section, citing this longer text or your arXiv papers for the complete details and examples.

By combining these additional examples, visuals, and discussion points, you’ll make the \emph{competitive distance} perspective more accessible to undergraduates while still offering a rigorous theoretical background that academic researchers can reference succinctly in journal or conference papers.

---

## Practicalities for Undergraduate vs. Condensed Research Version

Since you mentioned you aim to (a) have an undergraduate-friendly textbook chapter, and (b) condense into a short Background for an academic paper, you can:

1. **Undergraduate Textbook Version:**  
   - Retain the examples, numeric demonstrations, and figure references in the main text.  
   - Possibly add “exercises” at the end of each section (e.g., “Prove that if we scale all distances by \(\alpha\), the classification boundary does not change.”).

2. **Research Paper Condensed Version:**  
   - Move much of the explicit numeric examples and visual aids into either a small “Example” subsection or the supplement.  
   - Keep the theoretical statements and the references to the illusions or psychophysics as a succinct motivation.  
   - Summarize the entire “competitive distance” idea in maybe ~2 paragraphs, linking to your arXiv papers for details.
