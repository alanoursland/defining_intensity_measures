\subsection{Defining Distance Formally}

Distance is a fundamental measure in mathematics and applied sciences, quantifying the separation between two points in space. Unlike intensity, which lacks a universal mathematical definition and is often used heuristically, distance is rigorously defined through metric space axioms. This section introduces the formalism of distance measures, explores different types of distances used in classification, and lays the groundwork for understanding competitive distance as a critical concept in classification confidence.

\subsubsection{Metric Spaces and Distance Functions}

A \textbf{metric space} is a set \( X \) equipped with a function \( d: X \times X \to \mathbb{R} \) that satisfies specific properties ensuring a consistent measure of separation. This function \( d(x, y) \), called a \textbf{metric}, must satisfy the following axioms for all \( x, y, z \in X \):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Non-negativity:} The distance between any two points is always non-negative:
    \[
    d(x, y) \geq 0.
    \]
    \item \textbf{Identity of Indiscernibles:} The distance between a point and itself is zero, and only identical points have zero distance:
    \[
    d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y.
    \]
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} The distance from \( x \) to \( y \) is the same as from \( y \) to \( x \):
    \[
    d(x, y) = d(y, x).
    \]
    \item \textbf{Triangle Inequality:} The direct distance between two points is never greater than the sum of distances through an intermediate point:
    \[
    d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z).
    \]
\end{enumerate}

These properties ensure that distance behaves predictably and supports various mathematical operations, such as clustering, nearest-neighbor searches, and decision boundary calculations.

\subsubsection{Common Distance Metrics}

Several distance metrics are widely used in mathematics, data science, and machine learning. Each has unique properties that make it suitable for different applications:

\paragraph{Euclidean Distance}
The \textbf{Euclidean distance} is the most familiar metric, representing the straight-line distance between two points:
\[
    d_{\text{Euclidean}}(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2}.
\]
It is commonly used in clustering, nearest-neighbor methods, and gradient-based optimization.

\paragraph{Manhattan Distance}
The \textbf{Manhattan distance} (or \( L_1 \)-norm) measures distance along coordinate axes:
\[
    d_{\text{Manhattan}}(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|.
\]
This is useful in grid-based movement applications such as urban navigation and certain machine learning models where axis-aligned movement is relevant.

\paragraph{Mahalanobis Distance}
The \textbf{Mahalanobis distance} accounts for correlations between variables and adapts to different feature scales:
\[
    D_M(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - y)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - y)},
\]
where \( \Sigma \) is the covariance matrix of the dataset. This metric is widely used in anomaly detection and metric learning.

\paragraph{Cosine Distance}
The \textbf{cosine distance} measures the angular difference between two vectors:
\[
    d_{\text{cosine}}(x, y) = 1 - \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}.
\]
It is commonly used in text analysis and information retrieval, where directional similarity matters more than magnitude.

\paragraph{Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Divergence)}
Unlike the previous metrics, KL-divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution \( P \) diverges from another reference distribution \( Q \):
\[
    D_{\text{KL}}(P || Q) = \sum_i P(i) \log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}.
\]
Since it does not satisfy the triangle inequality, KL-divergence is not a true metric but is essential in probabilistic modeling and information theory.

\subsubsection{Distance as the Fundamental Measure}

A key property of distance is its universality: almost all similarity measures can be derived from distance functions, either through negation or transformation. Intensity measures, often used in classification, are typically functions of distance rather than independent quantities.

\paragraph{Introducing Competitive Distance}
A crucial insight in classification tasks is that intensity (e.g., neural activations) should be understood not as an absolute quantity but as a measure of **relative separation** between competing classes. This leads to the concept of \textbf{competitive distance}, which will be formalized in later sections.

Instead of simply measuring distance to a single class prototype \( D_c(x) \), competitive distance considers the separation between multiple competing classes:
\[
    S_c(x) = f(D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)).
\]
where:
- \( D_c(x) \) is the distance from \( x \) to the target class.
- \( D_{\neg c}(x) \) is the distance from \( x \) to the nearest competing class.
- \( S_c(x) \) represents intensity, now framed as a function of contrastive distances.

This framework provides a geometrically grounded approach to classification, improving interpretability and robustness in machine learning models. The next section will explore why intensity must be derived from contrastive distances rather than treated as an independent measure.
