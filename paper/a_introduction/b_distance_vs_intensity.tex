\section{Distance vs. Intensity: The Problem}

In many fields, the concepts of \textit{distance} and \textit{intensity} are used interchangeably or without formal distinction. While distance is rigorously defined in mathematics, intensity is often treated as an intuitive, heuristic measure of strength or presence. This lack of formalism creates inconsistencies, particularly in classification systems where confidence and decision-making rely on well-defined measures.

In this section, we examine the key differences between distance and intensity and highlight why intensity, as traditionally used, lacks a foundational definition.

\subsection{Distance: A Well-Defined Measure}

Distance is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. A properly defined distance function (or metric) satisfies key properties such as non-negativity, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. Some common distance measures include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Euclidean Distance:} Measures the straight-line separation between two points.
    \item \textbf{Mahalanobis Distance:} Adjusts for correlations and feature variances in multidimensional spaces.
    \item \textbf{Cosine Distance:} Measures angular separation between vectors rather than absolute magnitude.
\end{itemize}

These measures provide a \textbf{geometric basis for similarity and dissimilarity} in various mathematical spaces.

\subsection{Intensity: A Concept Without Formal Definition}

In contrast to distance, intensity is often used informally to describe the strength of a feature, probability, or classification confidence. Examples include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Brightness in Physics:} The intensity of light is often equated with amplitude squared.
    \item \textbf{Neural Network Activations:} The magnitude of an activation is assumed to correspond to the presence of a feature.
    \item \textbf{Classification Confidence:} Softmax outputs are interpreted as confidence scores, but their underlying mathematical meaning is ambiguous.
\end{itemize}

Unlike distance, intensity lacks a universal definition, leading to ambiguity in how it should be interpreted across different domains.

\subsection{Why the Traditional View of Intensity is Problematic}

Interpreting intensity as an independent measure leads to several problems:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lack of Scale Consistency:} Intensity is often defined in arbitrary units, making comparisons across different models or datasets difficult.
    \item \textbf{Unbounded Growth:} If intensity were simply a negation of distance, then maximizing intensity would drive distances toward negative infinity, which is not meaningful.
    \item \textbf{Overconfidence in Classification:} Traditional activation-based confidence measures can exaggerate certainty due to improper scaling.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Decision Boundary Awareness:} Intensity-based confidence does not inherently reflect how close a sample is to a decision boundary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Need for a Competitive Distance Framework}

Since intensity lacks a foundational definition, we propose redefining it in terms of \textit{contrastive distance}. Instead of treating intensity as an absolute measure, we introduce a framework where classification confidence is derived from the \textbf{difference between distances to competing classes}:

\[
S_c(x) = f(D_{\neg c}(x) - D_c(x)).
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( D_c(x) \) is the distance to the target class prototype.
    \item \( D_{\neg c}(x) \) is the distance to the closest non-target class.
    \item \( S_c(x) \) represents intensity, now properly defined as a function of relative distance.
\end{itemize}

This formulation ensures that classification confidence:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is grounded in geometric relationships between classes.
    \item Remains bounded and interpretable.
    \item Naturally aligns with decision boundaries and uncertainty estimation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

The lack of a formal definition for intensity has led to inconsistencies in classification confidence, neural activations, and probability scaling. By reframing intensity in terms of \textbf{competitive distance}, we provide a rigorous and interpretable measure that resolves these issues. The next section will outline the goals of this chapter and the key insights that will be developed in later sections.
